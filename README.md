# Good Soldiers Follow Orders

This Unity Project was developed for the Games and Simulation course in FCT.

It's a First Person Shooter with engaging movement mechanics and a small story with secrets that unveil multiple endings, all packaged in a Cyberpunk aesthetic.

This project helped strengthen my C# skills as well as many other aspects in game design, exploring the 4 elements of game design: Aesthetics, Mechanics, Story and Technology.
